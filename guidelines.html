          • To moderate the server, it requires you to have 2fa enabled.
          <br />
          • What is 2fa? having 2fa enabled allows you to secure your account
          and to access to your full permissions as a staff member, such as
          checking logs, deleting messages.
          <br />
          • If you do not know how to enable 2fa, make sure to check
          <a href="https://authy.com/guides/discord/" target="_blank">this</a>
          :
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Our main moderation bot is Dyno and the prefix of the bot is
          </strong>
          <mark class="code">" ? "</mark>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Verbal warnings:</strong>
          <br />
          • Staff can use verbal warnings when someone is close to breaking a
          rule but not quite fit for a bot warning. an example of verbal
          warning:
          <br />
          <mark>
            <span class="mention">@Oreo ™</span>
            refrain from using bot commands in general.
          </mark>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bot warnings:</strong>
          <br />
          • These are the first level of punishments; These are used to let the
          member know that their behavior is unacceptable and should they should
          stop. They are usually used when someone ignores 2 verbal warnings.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mutes</strong>
          <br />
          • These are the second level of punishments; The action of muting
          should be taken when the member continues to break a rule after one or
          two bot warnings. The default time of a mute is 10 minutes but the
          duration can vary:
          <mark>10m -> 30min -> 2h -> 6h.</mark>
          The duration is dependent on the severity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kicks/Temp bans</strong>
          <br />
          • These are the third level of punishments; These are used when the
          member, even after a long mute continues ignoring the rules in a short
          amount of time. The temp ban should last 2-4 days, basically when the
          member understands that their behavior is completely unacceptable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bans</strong>
          <br />
          • Bans are the last level of punishments; They should be taken if a
          member comes in and start trolling or being
          nsfw/racist/homophobic/excessively toxic. If someone advertises in
          your DMs or is underaged
          <i>(we do follow the Discord TOS)</i>
          , you are allowed to immediately ban them from the server
          <i>(make sure to provide proof)</i>
          .
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <center><h3>More information about the punishments</h3></center>
        <p>
          <strong>Permanent Mute</strong>
          <br />
          • A member comes in and starts trolling; You can smell a troll from
          miles away.
          <br />
          • A member has an inappropriate profile picture/username and is
          calling attention to it
          <i>(Nsfw/Slur)</i>
          <br />
          • A member who has said a slur/posted NSFW in the server
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ban</strong>
          <br />
          • Advertising in DMs/chat
          <br />
          • Members who are under the age of 13
          <i>(underaged)</i>
          <br />
          • Members who troll/racism/homophobia
          <i>(does not include comments)</i>
          <br />
          • Members who leak personal info
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Verbal warn & then Bot warn</strong>
          <br />
          • Channel misuse, verbal warn -> bot warn if continued - for example
          bot commands in #general:
          <i>(direct warn if spammed)</i>
          <br />
          • Small spam (smashing keyboard - slow spam), verbal warn -> warn/mute
          (30 mins), depends on the severity
          <br />
          • Talking in another language - same as the above
          <br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Please make sure to treat everyone the same way, we do not allow bias.
          Having 2 or 3 strikes will result into a demotion, inactivity for
          longer than 3 days will result into a verbal warning (we will ask you
          what’s happening) and if you do not give an answer within 2 days you
          will get demoted. Use common sense everyone.
        </p>

          <strong>Giving rejoining members levels</strong>
          <br />
          • If a member leaves the server and rejoins back, dont give them back
          100% of their levels back
          <br />
          • Instead give them back 75% of the levels they had before leaving
          <br />
          •
          <mark>
            <span class="code">newLevel = (currentLevel / 100) * 75</span>
          </mark>
          <br />
          • You can use the command
          <mark><span class="code">/xp set level</span></mark>
          to set the new level for a member
